For cognising all inputs of perception the brain must process the information to create the right associations,
therefore it means to place any kind of sensory information in context, it must run through the information processing network of the brain
resulting in neurons firing actively as a result of any sensory input.

In case of ESP there are no defined senses from where information is coming from, 
however there should be a correlated neural activity for triggering events as a response.

For testing the response to triggering events there are multiple aspects needed to be taken into account.
The "strength" of the triggering event. 
The response frequency/regeneration/tiredness of the firing zone.
The delay of the response.
The sensitivity of the person to the specific triggering event.
Background noise in mental processes.
Triggering cue and person pairing, the difficulty of generalization and screening of test candidates

Triggering event: Change of environmental conditions weighted by the persons attentivity, a metric 
representing the importance of triggering event from the observing person`s perspective, perception and biases
(a sensitivity map for environmental changes such as the cortical homonculus for bodily sensations )
